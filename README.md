# Virtual-Digital-Logic
Use c++ to implement the digital logic
## The requirement for the input data
### part 1
1) The first line comes with the number of the logical circuits you want to implement
2)  Then every electrical circuit obeys the following input standard
3)  The first line comes with two int data indicating the numbers of input ports and devices respectively(assuming as m & n)
4)  The next m lines define every device as the following way.
5)  First it's the name of device, it mab be `NOT,AND,OR,NAND,NOR,XOR`
6)  Then comes the number of the input ports
7)  Next are the names of several input ports, and there is a prefix
